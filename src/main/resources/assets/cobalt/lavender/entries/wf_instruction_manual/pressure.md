If too many systems are in use, **pressure in pipes** may increase.

---

Take care to not let pressure reach {red}**critical levels**{}. This will force excess air to vent, which might harm personnel in the facility.

;;;;;

**Emergency pressure valves** are located throughout the facility. When activated, they will slowly drain pipe pressure.

The current pressure level can be seen on Control Room side panels, or using %{item.cobalt.mechanic_spectacles}%.

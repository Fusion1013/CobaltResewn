Located in various key locations around the facility are **Pneumatic Transportation Tubes**.

Once a Transportation Tube has been **activated**, it can be used to travel to and from the **closest Control Room**.

Do note that using a Transportation Tube **will increase pressure** slightly, so only use them when absolutely necessary.

Power is supplied on-site through the use of **Power Cells**. Power Cells are drained while systems are in use.

Take care to **disable any systems** that are not needed.

;;;;;

**Empty Power cells** can be recharged at **Recharge Stations**. These are marked in {dark_purple}**Purple**{} on control room maps.

Use **Maintenance Routes** to reach if power is down.

The current power level can be seen on Control Room side panels, or using %{item.cobalt.mechanic_spectacles}%.

{dark_aqua}**Water**{} can be redirected through pipes using one of the large **Wall Panels**.

Make sure no workers are located inside rooms that water is being redirected to, to avoid drowning accidents.

;;;;;

**Any pipes** that are currently **not needed** for current operations should immediately be **switched off**, as any active pipes will **drain power**.
